# MVCommons
MVCommons - RPG Maker MV Community Core Library

## What thas this do?

This library aims to get a lot of common reusage of actual and usefull things in RPG Maker MV.
While for Things like XP we have the MACL, there is no alternative for MV.
This will be the alternative.

This module aims to be small, not a giant and messy plugin.
It helps you to extend classes, to make getters and setters and many things.
